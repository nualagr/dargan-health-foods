Spirulina is 69 percent complete protein, with all the essential amino acids in perfect balance. In comparison beef is only 22 percent protein.  Spirulina also provides high concentrations of many other nutrients – amino acids, chelated minerals, pigments, rhamnose sugars (complex natural plant sugars), trace elements, enzymes (SOD) and essential fatty acids (both linoleic and linolenic acid) – that are all in an easily assimilable form. Spirulina is one of the blue-green algae due to the presence of both chlorophyll (green) and phycocyanin (blue) pigments in its cellular structure. Spirulina lacks cellulose cell walls, unlike other blue/green algae, therefore it can be easily digested.

Electrolytes are mineral salts dissolved in the body’s blood and fluid, they carry an electric charge and therefore can affect the blood’s pH and muscle function. Mineral salts include sodium, chloride, magnesium and potassium and these are involved in balancing the fluid throughout the body including the volume of fluid within the blood. Water movement is controlled by the concentration of electrolytes on either side of the cell membrane. Exercise increases fluid loss through sweat. If this fluid is not replaced then dehydration will occur. Dehydration impairs performance as blood volume decreases and body temperature increases; extra strain will be put on the heart and lungs. The loss of fluid will also lead to an electrolyte imbalance as sodium and potassium are lost through the skin. This imbalance can cause a disruption to the cell’s ability to carry electrical charges. Viridian’s Sports Electrolyte fix contains all the necessary electrolytes in an ionic form as well as all other minerals naturally present in sea water. Ionic refers to the mineral being ionically charged (attached to a negatively charged mineral complex). It is important that the electrolytes are present in an ionic form as this is necessary for effective hydration. In a study looking into the importance of electrolytes for rehydration, eight participants consumed plain water, and eight participants consumed water plus an electrolyte additive. The addition of an electrolyte mixture to plain water decreased the overall fluid levels required for optimal hydration compared to the plain water group. Supplementing water with electrolytes can therefore minimise carrying excessive weight, possibly reducing fatigue during extended exercise.

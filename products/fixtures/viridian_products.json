This is a two-a-day supplement. Vitamin C plays an essential role in numerous areas of human health. Vitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for the normal function of bones, cartilage, skin, gums and teeth.  Vitamin C also enhances iron absorption and the normal energy-yielding metabolism. Vitamin C aids in the maintenance of the immune system including during and after intense physical exercise. Vitamin C contributes to normal psychological function, the functioning of the nervous system and contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases.  B complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 & B12) contribute to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue, to normal psychological function and mental performance, energy-yielding metabolism, the regulation of hormonal activity, the functioning of the immune, cardio and nervous systems and the maintenance of normal skin, mucous membranes, vision and red blood cells. B complex vitamins also contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases. Vitamin D contributes to the maintenance of normal bones, teeth, muscle function and immune function.  MultiPhytoNutrient Complex is iron free.",

Zinc also contributes to the normal metabolism of fatty acids and macronutrients. Selenium contributes to normal spermatogenesis (the creation of sperm), to the maintenance of normal hair and nails, the normal function of the immune system, normal thyroid function and for the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases.

Zinc is a mineral essential to many body processes including the maintenance of normal cognitive function, vision, fertility and reproduction, hair, skin and nails and the immune system. Zinc also contributes to the normal metabolism of fatty acids and macronutrients. Selenium contributes to normal spermatogenesis (the creation of sperm), to the maintenance of normal hair and nails, the normal function of the immune system, normal thyroid function and for the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases. Copper contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism, the maintenance of normal connective tissues, to the normal pigmentation of hair and skin, the normal function of the nervous and immune systems, and for the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases. Vitamin E has a role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases. Vitamin C plays an essential role in numerous areas of human health. Vitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for the normal function of bones, cartilage, skin, gums and teeth.  Vitamin C also enhances iron absorption and the normal energy-yielding metabolism. Vitamin C aids in the maintenance of the immune system including during and after intense physical exercise.

Spirulina is 69 percent complete protein, with all the essential amino acids in perfect balance. In comparison beef is only 22 percent protein. Spirulina also provides high concentrations of many other nutrients \u2013 amino acids, chelated minerals, pigments, rhamnose sugars (complex natural plant sugars), trace elements, enzymes (SOD), and essential fatty acids (both linoleic and linolenic acid) \u2013 that are all in an easily assimilable form. Spirulina is one of the blue-green algae due to the presence of both chlorophyll (green) and phycocyanin (blue) pigments in its cellular structure. Spirulina lacks cellulose cell walls, unlike other blue/green algae, therefore it can be easily digested. Viridian\u2019s Spirulina is certified organic by the following organisations: Soil Association, ECOcert, Naturland, USDA NOP and IFOAM. Also available as an excipient-free 100% active tablet.",

            "product_information": "Sports Electrolyte Fix is an intense electrolyte liquid, sourced from the Great Salt Lake, Utah in the USA. Electrolytes are mineral salts dissolved in the body\u2019s blood and fluid, they carry an electric charge and therefore can affect the blood\u2019s pH and muscle function. Mineral salts include sodium, chloride, magnesium and potassium and these are involved in balancing the fluid throughout the body including the volume of fluid within the blood. Water movement is controlled by the concentration of electrolytes on either side of the cell membrane. Exercise increases fluid loss through sweat. If this fluid is not replaced then dehydration will occur. Dehydration impairs performance as blood volume decreases and body temperature increases; extra strain will be put on the heart and lungs. The loss of fluid will also lead to an electrolyte imbalance as sodium and potassium are lost through the skin. This imbalance can cause a disruption to the cell\u2019s ability to carry electrical charges. Viridian\u2019s Sports Electrolyte fix contains all the necessary electrolytes in an ionic form as well as all other minerals naturally present in sea water. Ionic refers to the mineral being ionically charged (attached to a negatively charged mineral complex). It is important that the electrolytes are present in an ionic form as this is necessary for effective hydration. In a study looking into the importance of electrolytes for rehydration, eight participants consumed plain water, and eight participants consumed water plus an electrolyte additive. The addition of an electrolyte mixture to plain water decreased the overall fluid levels required for optimal hydration compared to the plain water group. Supplementing water with electrolytes can therefore minimise carrying excessive weight, possibly reducing fatigue during extended exercise. This product is comprised of a blend of naturally occurring brine from the Great Salt Lake containing sodium, magnesium, chloride and potassium as well as vast array of other trace and ultra trace elements.",

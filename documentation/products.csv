B12 contributes to normal homocysteine metabolism and red blood cell formation, to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue, the energy-yielding metabolism, to normal psychological function and the functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 also contributes to the normal function of the immune system. Folic acid (folate) contributes to a reduction in tiredness and fatigue, the normal function of the immune system, normal psychological function, and the processes of normal homocysteine metabolism, amino acid synthesis, cell division and blood formation. B complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 & B12) contribute to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue, to normal psychological function and mental performance, energy-yielding metabolism, the regulation of hormonal activity, the functioning of the immune, cardio and nervous systems and the maintenance of normal skin, mucous membranes, vision and red blood cells. B complex vitamins also contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. This 'oxidative stress' appears to be a major factor in many human diseases.

,products.product,0302,,Sports Electrolyte Fix Liquid - 100ml,Sports Electrolyte Fix Liquid ,viridian,100,ml,€18.35,T1,"Sports Electrolyte Fix is an intense electrolyte liquid, sourced from the Great Salt Lake, Utah in the USA. Electrolytes are mineral salts dissolved in the body’s blood and fluid, they carry an electric charge and therefore can affect the blood’s pH and muscle function. Mineral salts include sodium, chloride, magnesium and potassium and these are involved in balancing the fluid throughout the body including the volume of fluid within the blood. Water movement is controlled by the concentration of electrolytes on either side of the cell membrane. Exercise increases fluid loss through sweat. If this fluid is not replaced then dehydration will occur. Dehydration impairs performance as blood volume decreases and body temperature increases; extra strain will be put on the heart and lungs. The loss of fluid will also lead to an electrolyte imbalance as sodium and potassium are lost through the skin. This imbalance can cause a disruption to the cell’s ability to carry electrical charges. Viridian’s Sports Electrolyte fix contains all the necessary electrolytes in an ionic form as well as all other minerals naturally present in sea water. Ionic refers to the mineral being ionically charged (attached to a negatively charged mineral complex). It is important that the electrolytes are present in an ionic form as this is necessary for effective hydration. In a study looking into the importance of electrolytes for rehydration, eight participants consumed plain water, and eight participants consumed water plus an electrolyte additive. The addition of an electrolyte mixture to plain water decreased the overall fluid levels required for optimal hydration compared to the plain water group. Supplementing water with electrolytes can therefore minimise carrying excessive weight, possibly reducing fatigue during extended exercise. This product is comprised of a blend of naturally occurring brine from the Great Salt Lake containing sodium, magnesium, chloride and potassium as well as vast array of other trace and ultra trace elements.",Electrolyte Mix 3mg,TRUE,0,"Directions: Take 2.5ml (approx. half a teaspoon) to 10ml (approx. two teaspoons) daily as required, or as directed by your healthcare professional.

,products.product,0469,,Synerbio Saccharomyces Boulardii - 30 Veg Caps,Synerbio S-Boulardii 30 Caps,viridian,30,caps,€31.60,T1,"Synerbio Saccharomyces boulardii Veg Caps is an expert formulation comprising good gut bacteria (commonly known as probiotics) with added ‘prebiotics’. The non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii was first discovered by French microbiologist, Henri Boulard in 1920 in the skin of Lychee fruit. Considered an ideal supplement to take alongside antibiotics, and when travelling overseas. This remarkable yeast is one of the great success stories in probiotic therapy. 
Synerbio Saccharomyces boulardii also includes strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, plus prebiotics. The unique Prebiotic FS2-60 offers full-spectrum prebiotic oligosaccharide and plant-derived inulin. FS2-60 is not digested but is utilised by the friendly flora to increase colonisation of Lactobacilli and the Bifidobacteria whilst reducing the foothold of unfriendly species. Dairy-free. The human gut is home to an immense population of bacteria. Some 100 trillion bacteria populate the human gut, a number that is 10 times greater than the number of cells in the human body. Because of the sheer size and importance of the gut bacteria, this microbial population can be viewed as a bacterial organ, about the size of your liver and just as important. There are some 400 species of bacteria in the gut including Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, and Peptostreptococcus. Gut bacteria with identified as suitable ingredients in food supplements include Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. It is critical to the maintenance of human health that a balance is preserved between these species.","Saccharomyces boulardii 250mg,
